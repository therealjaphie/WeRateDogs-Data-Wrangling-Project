    "The dataset provided for wrangling is the tweet archive of twitter user WeRateDogs. Additional data is also to be sourced programmatically to supplement this data. WeRateDogs is a very famous twitter account with over 4 million followers, that has gained wide media coverage over the years for their humorous contents about dogs. Created in 2015, it started rating dogs and have continued to do so till date. Using a metric score of 10, most dogs have been rated with numerator values higher than 10 by WeRateDogs for the simple reason that they are good dogs, [Brent](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)!(click to find out about this inside joke!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The twitter archive contains basic tweet data such as tweet_id, timestamp, dog_stage, twitter url etc. Additional data is to be obtained by querying Twitter's API as well as downloading programatically, a dataset about the top 3 predictions of dog breeds by an algorithm using images contained in the twitter archive. \n",

    "The results obtained from the neural network algorithm that was used to predict dog breeds from @WeRateDogs twitter archive, stored in `image_predictions_clean` and then merged with the `twitter_df_clean` table, show that the attribute *p1* is its topmost prediction with the highest confidence level.\n",
